# Intro-to-Programming-Sp2025
A collection of programs written during my Spring 2025 Intro to Programming Class. 

Each week consists of a description of what was learned. Nearly everything is cumulative, so descriptions show the initial instance of topics.

My Professor allows us quite a lot of freedom when writing our programs. So, this is less a syllabus for the class and more a reflection of my own learning journey.
