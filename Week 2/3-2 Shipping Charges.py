## Program 3-13 Shipping Charges
**Prof's Notes**: *Assume charge is calculated for individual packages and not for a combined weight of packages. For
example, if you have 5 packages 2# each, you would charge for each package. You would not charge the
rate for 10# for all the packages.*

**Problem** (pg200)
Write a program that asks the user to enter the weight of a package then displays the shipping charges.
