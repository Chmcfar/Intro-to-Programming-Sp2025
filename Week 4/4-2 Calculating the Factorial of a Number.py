"""
Note in the same program, I want you to calculate factorial by two methods. The first using a loop as
already noted. The second is using the math function factorial. The factorial function is in the math library
that you import into your program by using the statement

import math

Find the factorial function in that library (remember I told you how). To use the function, you type
something like

x = math.xxx(input_var)

Where xxx is the factorial function (hey, I am not going to give it to you-that would take all the fun out of
this problem).

Some comments. 0! = 1. Do not try big numbers. Don‚Äôt go any higher than 10!

Test with 0! = 1, 5! = 120.
____
In mathematics, the notation ùëõ! represents the factorial of the nonnegative integer ùëõ. The factorial of ùëõ is
defined as the product of all the nonnegative integers from 1 to ùëõ. For example,

7! = 1√ó2√ó3√ó4√ó5√ó6√ó7 = 5,040

and

4! = 1√ó2√ó3√ó4 = 24

Write a program that lets the user enter a nonnegative integer (check for this) then uses a loop to calculate
the factorial of that number. Display the factorial.
